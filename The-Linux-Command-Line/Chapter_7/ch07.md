## Commands

`echo` - Display a line of text  
`echo` is a shell builtin. It prints out its text arguments on standard output.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo

himanshu in practice: echo Hello
Hello
himanshu in practice:
```

## Expansion

Each time you type a command line and press the ENTER key, bash performs several processes upon the text before it carries out your command. `*`, can have a lot of meaning to the shell. The process that makes this happen is called **expansion**. With expansion, you enter something, and it is expanded into something else before the shell acts upon it.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo *
dir1 dir2 fun-hard ls.txt UserInput.txt
```

Shell do not print `*` but it gets expanded into something else (in this instance, the names of the files in the current working directory) before the `echo` command is executed. So the echo command never saw the `*`, only its expanded result.

### Pathname Expansion

```bash
himanshu in practice: ls
dir1  dir2  fun-hard  ls.txt  UserInput.txt
himanshu in practice: echo d*
dir1 dir2
himanshu in practice: echo *t
ls.txt UserInput.txt
himanshu in practice: echo [[:upper:]]*
UserInput.txt
```

### Arithmetic Expansion

Arithmetic expansion uses the following form: `$((expression))`

Arithmetic expansion supports only integers (whole numbers, no decimals).

```bash
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division ('But remember, because expansion supports only integer arithmetic results are integers.')
% Modulo, ('which simply means remainder')
** Exponentiation
```

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo $((2+3))
5
himanshu in practice: echo $((2-3))
-1
himanshu in practice: echo $((2*3))
6
himanshu in practice: echo $((2/3))
0
himanshu in practice: echo $((2**3))
8
himanshu in practice: echo $((2%3))
2
```

Spaces are not significant in arithmetic expressions, and expressions may be nested. Single parentheses may be used to group multiple subexpressions.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo $(( $((5**2)) * 3))
75
himanshu in practice: echo $(( (5**2) * 3))
75
```

### Brace Expansion

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo Front-{A,B,C}-Back
Front-A-Back Front-B-Back Front-C-Back
```

Patterns to be brace expanded may contain a **leading portion** called a
**preamble** and a **trailing portion** called a **postscript**.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo Number_{1..5}
Number_1 Number_2 Number_3 Number_4 Number_5
himanshu in practice: echo {Z..A}
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A
himanshu in practice: echo {z..a}
z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
himanshu in practice: echo {20..1}
20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

Brace expansions may be nested.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b
aA1b aA2b aB3b aB4b
```

Uses

```bash
himanshu in practice: mkdir Pics
himanshu in practice: cd Pics
himanshu in practice: mkdir {2009..2011}-0{1..9} {2009..2011}-{10..12}
himanshu in practice: ls
2009-01 2009-07 2010-01 2010-07 2011-01 2011-07
2009-02 2009-08 2010-02 2010-08 2011-02 2011-08
2009-03 2009-09 2010-03 2010-09 2011-03 2011-09
2009-04 2009-10 2010-04 2010-10 2011-04 2011-10
2009-05 2009-11 2010-05 2010-11 2011-05 2011-11
```

### Parameter Expansion

Variable named `USER` contains your username.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo $USER
himanshu
```

To see a list of available variables, try this: `$ printenv | less`

### Command Substitution

Allows us to use the output of a command as an expansion:

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo $(ls)
dir1 dir2 fun-hard ls.txt UserInput.txt
himanshu in practice: ls -l $(which cp) # to know the permission on cp binary
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 153976 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/cp
```

### Quoting

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo this is a       test
this is a test
himanshu in practice: echo The total is $100.00
The total is 00.00
```

In the first example, word splitting by the shell removed extra whitespace from the echo commandâ€™s list of arguments. In the second example, parameter expansion substituted an empty string for the value of $1 because it was an undefined variable. The shell provides a mechanism called quoting to selectively suppress unwanted expansions.

#### Double Quotes

If you place text inside **double quotes**, all the special characters used by the shell lose their special meaning and are treated as ordinary characters. The exceptions are `$` (dollar sign), `\` (backslash), and ` (back tick). This means that **word splitting**, **pathname expansion**, **tilde expansion**, and **brace expansion** are suppressed, but **parameter expansion**, **arithmetic expansion**, and **command substitution** are still carried out.

```bash
himanshu in practice: touch "New File.txt"
himanshu in practice: ls
 dir1   dir2   fun-hard   ls.txt  'New File.txt'   UserInput.txt
himanshu in practice: ls -l New File.txt
ls: cannot access 'New': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'File.txt': No such file or directory
himanshu in practice: ls -l "New File.txt"
-rw-rw-r-- 1 himanshu himanshu 0 Apr 13 10:19 'New File.txt'
himanshu in practice: mv "New File.txt" "New_File.txt"
himanshu in practice: ls
dir1  dir2  fun-hard  ls.txt  New_File.txt  UserInput.txt
```

Remember: **Parameter expansion**, **arithmetic expansion**, and **command
substitution** still take place within double quotes

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo "$USER $((2+2)) $(cal)"
himanshu 4      April 2021       
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
             1  2  3  
 4  5  6  7  8  9 10  
11 12 13 14 15 16 17  
18 19 20 21 22 23 24  
25 26 27 28 29 30 
```

By default, word splitting looks for the presence of spaces, tabs, and newlines (linefeed characters) and treats them as delimiters between words. This means that unquoted spaces, tabs, and newlines are not considered to be part of the text. They serve only as separators. Since they separate the words into different arguments, our example command line contains a command followed by four distinct arguments.

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo Hello      Linux
Hello Linux
himanshu in practice: echo "Hello      Linux"
Hello      Linux
```

#### Single Quotes

If we need to suppress all expansions, we use single quotes.

```bash
himanshu in practice: # without quotes
himanshu in practice: echo text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER
text /home/himanshu/*.txt a b foo 4 himanshu
himanshu in practice: # with double quotes
himanshu in practice: echo "text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER"
text ~/*.txt {a,b} foo 4 himanshu
himanshu in practice: # single quote
himanshu in practice: echo 'text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER'
text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER
```

#### Escaping Characters

```bash
himanshu in practice: echo "The balance for user $USER is: \$5.00"
The balance for user himanshu is: $5.00
```
