# Chapter 10

## Commands

- `ps` - Report a snapshot of current processes.
- `top` - Display tasks.
- `jobs` - List active jobs.
- `bg` - Place a job in the background.
- `fg` - Place a job in the foreground.
- `kill` - Send a signal to a process.
- `killall` - Kill processes by name.
- `shutdown` - Shut down or reboot the system

## How a Process Works

When a system starts up, the kernel initiates a few of its own activities as processes and launches a program called **init**. **init**, in turn, runs a series of **shell scripts** (located in **/etc**) called **init** scripts, which start all the system services. Many of these services are implemented as **daemon programs**, programs that just sit in the background and do their thing without having any user interface. So even if we are not logged in, the system is at least a little busy performing routine stuff.

The fact that a program can launch other programs is expressed in the process scheme as a parent process producing a child process.

The kernel maintains information about each process to help keep things organized. For example, each process is assigned a number called a **process ID** (PID). **PIDs** are assigned in ascending order, with **init** always getting **PID 1**. The kernel also keeps track of the memory assigned to each process, as well as the processes readiness to resume execution. Like files, processes also have owners and user IDs, effective user IDs, and so on.

### ps

```bash
himanshu in ~: ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   6604 pts/3    00:00:00 bash
  18885 pts/3    00:00:00 ps
```

To view currently up processes. **TTY** is short for **teletype** and refers to the **controlling terminal for the process**. The **TIME** field is the amount of **CPU** time consumed by the process.

Adding the `x` option (note that there is no leading dash) tells `ps` to show all of our processes regardless of what terminal (if any) they are controlled by. The presence of a `?` in the TTY column indicates no controlling terminal.

### ps x

```bash
himanshu in ~: ps x
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
   2044 ?        Ss     0:00 /lib/systemd/systemd --user
   2045 ?        S      0:00 (sd-pam)
   2050 ?        S<sl   0:04 /usr/bin/pulseaudio --daemonize=no --log-target=journal
   2052 ?        SNsl   0:00 /usr/libexec/tracker-miner-fs
   2055 ?        Ss     0:01 /usr/bin/dbus-daemon --session --address=systemd: --nofork --nopidfile --systemd-activation --syslog-only
   2071 ?        Ssl    0:00 /usr/libexec/gvfsd
```

A new column titled **STAT** has been added to the output. **STAT** is short for **state** and reveals the **current status** of the process.

#### Process State

- `R` Running. The process is running or ready to run.

- `S` Sleeping. The process is not running; rather, it is waiting for an event, such as a keystroke or network packet.

- `D` Uninterruptible sleep. Process is waiting for I/O such as a disk drive.

- `T` Stopped. Process has been instructed to stop (more on this later).

- `Z` A defunct or “zombie” process. This is a child process that has terminated but has not been cleaned up by its parent.

- `<` A high-priority process. It’s possible to grant more importance to a process, giving it more time on the CPU. This property of a process is called niceness. A process with high priority is said to be less nice because it’s taking more of the CPU’s time, which leaves less for everybody else.

- `N` A low-priority process. A process with low priority (a nice process)
will get processor time only after other processes with higher priority
have been serviced.

Another popular set of options is `aux`. This set of options displays the processes belonging to every user.

### ps aux

```bash
himanshu in ~: ps aux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root           1  0.0  0.1 170520 12936 ?        Ss   09:13   0:03 /sbin/init splash
root           2  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    09:13   0:00 [kthreadd]
root           3  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        I<   09:13   0:00 [rcu_gp]
root           4  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        I<   09:13   0:00 [rcu_par_gp]
```

- `USER` or `User ID`. This is the owner of the process.

- `%CPU` CPU usage as a percent.

- `%MEM` Memory usage as a percent.

- `VSZ` Virtual memory size.

- `RSS` Resident Set Size. The amount of physical memory (RAM) the process is using in kilobytes.

- `START` Time when the process started. For values over 24 hours, a date is used.

#### Viewing Processes Dynamically with top

ps command provides only a snapshot of the machine’s state at the moment the `ps` command is executed. To see a more dynamic view of the machine’s activity, we
use the top command:

```bash
top - 11:38:03 up  2:24,  1 user,  load average: 0.56, 0.33, 0.36
Tasks: 243 total,   1 running, 242 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  3.5 us,  1.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.5 id,  0.8 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
MiB Mem :   7741.8 total,   2574.3 free,   1451.7 used,   3715.7 buff/cache
MiB Swap:   2048.0 total,   2048.0 free,      0.0 used.   5642.2 avail Mem

```

The `top` display consists of two parts: a **system summary** at the top of the display, followed by **a table of processes sorted by CPU activity**.

##### top Information Fields

###### Row 1

- `top`: Name of the program.

- `14:59:20`: Current time of day.

- `up 2:24`: This is called uptime. It is the amount of time since the machine was last booted. In this example, the system has been up for 2½ hours.

- `1 users`: One users are logged in.

- `load average`: Load average refers to the number of processes that are waiting to run; that is, the number of processes that are in a runnable state and are sharing the CPU. Three values are shown, each for a different period of time. The first is the average for the last 60 seconds, the next the previous 5 minutes,
and finally the previous 15 minutes. Values under 1.0 indicate that the machine is not busy.

###### Row 2

- `Tasks`: This summarizes the number of processes and their various process states.

- `0.7%us`: 0.7% of the CPU is being used for user processes. This means processes outside of the kernel itself.

- `1.0%sy` 1.0% of the CPU is being used for system (kernel) processes.

- `0.0%ni` 0.0% of the CPU is being used by nice (low-priority) processes.

- `98.3%id` 98.3% of the CPU is idle.

- `0.0%wa` 0.0% of the CPU is waiting for I/O.

###### Row 3

- `Mem`: Shows how physical RAM is being used.

###### Row 4

- `Swap`: Shows how swap space (virtual memory) is being used.

## Controlling Processes

Simply displays a resizable window containing the X logo
