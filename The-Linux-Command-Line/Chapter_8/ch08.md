## Using History

`bash` maintains a history of commands that have been entered. This list of commands is kept in your home directory in a file called `.bash_history`.

To view history of commands

```bash
himanshu in ~: history
himanshu in ~: history | less # for viewing in less
```

Or simply press up arrow to start looking the most recent commands you have entered. By default, bash stores the last 500 commands you have entered.

 Letâ€™s say we want to find the commands we used to list /usr/bin.

 ```bash
 himanshu in ~: history | grep /usr/bin
 1711  ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | less
 1712  ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | less
 1713  ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq -d | less
 1738  ls /usr/bin | tail -n 5
 1742  ls /usr/bin
 ```

The number 1738 is the line number of the command in the history list.
We could use this immediately with another type of expansion called **history expansion**. Using an `!` mark.

```bash
himanshu in ~: !1738
ls /usr/bin | tail -n 5
zipsplit
zjsdecode
zless
zmore
znew
```

`bash` also provides the ability to search the history list incrementally. This means that we can tell `bash` to search the history list as we enter characters, with each additional character further refining our search. To start an incremental search, enter `CTRL-R` followed by the text you are looking for. When you find it, you can either press `ENTER` to execute the command or press `CTRL-J` to copy the line from the history list to the current command line.
